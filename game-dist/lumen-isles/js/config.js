  /* -------- speech: how the teacher voice says things --------
     Single letters are the weak spot in every browser speech engine. A bare
     "a" is read as the article ("uh"), and the obvious respelling "ay" comes
     out as "eye" on some voices. So every letter gets an explicit respelling
     using a word the engine cannot mistake.

     Voices genuinely disagree, and we cannot hear what a given iPad does, so
     `letterAlts` holds other spellings a parent can pick from in
     Parents → Reports & Settings → Voice check. Their choice is saved on that
     device only (a different iPad may have a different voice). -------- */
